# Front-End-Web-Development-CTEC3905

## Project notes
In this project we will be creating a front-end website for our client Platinum Car Hire.  
This front-end website will be a way for their customers to gain information about the  
cars they are offering to hire and how they can hire them. The website will also include  
FAQâ€™s on the policies on hiring the cars from Platinum Car Hire.
